The version of node is limited by what pkg can handle.  See
https://vercel.com/docs/runtimes to find the latest supported.  When that
supports node v16.x or later, the digger modules will need to switch from
"require" usage to import/export declarations so instead of

const path = require("path");
const hub = require("./server/hub");

it will be 

import * as path from "path";
import { hub } from "./server/hub.js";

and on the declarations side instead of

module.exports = (function () {...

it will be 

export let hub = (function () {...

-----------

Download the version of node needed from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
e.g. node-v14.18.1.pkg  That will install appropriate node and npm.  Then

npm install jsmediatags --save
npm install node-static
npm i -S formidable
npm install node-fetch@2
