Copy the Digger.app to your applications or anywhere else you want.

Digger.app is the digger-macos unix executable with a launch script and
icon.  Just enough so you can put it in the Dock.  Opening the app opens a
terminal and runs the server.  Close the terminal to stop it.

See https://github.com/theriex/digger for configuration options.
