You can just launch Digger.app directly.  You don't need to copy it to your
Applications folder, but you can copy it there or anywhere else if you want.

Digger.app is the digger-macos unix executable packaged with just enough
basic info to allow it to be placed in the Dock.  That's its only purpose.
When you open the app, it starts the Digger server, which keeps running
until you force quit the app.  There is no interface.

See https://github.com/theriex/digger for configuration options.
