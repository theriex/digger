digger-macos is a unix executable.  Double clicking it will open a terminal
running digger, so you can watch the server console messages.

Digger.dmg is the distribution for Digger.app, which bundles up digger-macos
with an icon so it can be placed in the dock.  The app has no interface.

digger-linux is an alternative to simply cloning the project and running
digger.js directly in node.  Might be helpful if you don't want to
complicate your existing node environment or bother setting it up.

digger-win.exe probably works, but I don't have a windows machine so I
haven't tested it or set up an appropriate spawn command.
