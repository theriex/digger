# digger
music library fetch tool

Digger has one primary purpose: To pull songs that have been sitting
neglected in your library.  Digger supports song rating and retrieval
filtering.  It can help with export and cleanup.  It does not try to be a
DJ.

To run:
    node digger.js ~/Music
Then go to http://localhost:6980
