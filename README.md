# digger
Contextual music library access.

## Concept

Digger is a web server that allows you to access your music based on your
listening context.  Working?  Commuting?  Party?  When do *you* want to have
music playing without having to think about it?

Digger lets you to create your own music retrieval contexts, then pushbutton
tag your music for those situations.  Continuous value knobs let you dial in
energy level and approachability.  The digger controls let you get back to
enjoying your music collection without having to examine a long list of
files just to get some appropriate noise in the room.  Just fire up the
digger server, then access it through your browser.

what's on deck to copy a playlist to another device.
