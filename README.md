# digger
music library fetch tool

Digger has one primary purpose: To pull songs that have been sitting
neglected in your library.  Digger supports song rating and retrieval
filtering.  It can help with export and cleanup.  It does not try to be a
DJ.

Digger runs on <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">node.js</a> with help from <a href="https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags">jsmediatags</a>.
