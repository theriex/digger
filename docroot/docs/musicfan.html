<h1>Music Fans</h1>

<p>A music fan is someone whose musical listening interests and reactions
you respect and enjoy.  You might not agree on everything, but you
definitely agree on some things, and you might share tips and reactions to
various songs and artists. </p>

<p>Back in the day, when you went over to a someone's house, you might check
out their album collection, see how much you recognize, check out what you
don't recognize, and maybe talk about what you've been listening to
recently.  They might play something they think you should hear, or let you
choose something to put on.  This type of interaction didn't scale into the
digital age like radio or mixtapes.  There are several reasons for this:</p>
<ul>

<li>Casually browsing other people's music collections doesn't work anymore
because albums are no longer part of the room.  They exist on screen.

<li>Without the constraints of physical space, libraries have grown very
large.

<li>With a large collection, it takes more effort and knowledge to find
something appropriate to suggest.

</ul>

<p>How we access our collections needs help to make it easier to enjoy our
music and bring back fan interactions like the following: </p>


<h2>Have you heard...</h2>

<p>Some of the most treasured music in my collection came from fans that
pointed out gems I hadn't discovered yet.  If they hadn't clued me in, I
might have missed out on music I've listened to for years since.</p>

<p>Digger supports suggestions of new music from fans.  If a music source
supports it, fan-suggested songs matching your current retrieval parameters
can be included on deck.  When you play a recommended song, it gets added to
your collection with the ratings you set.  You can activate up to 4 fans at
once all providing suggestions of music to play. </p>


<h2>This song is amazing!</h2>

<p>Sometimes when you listen to a song or album, the experience is so great
you need to let other fans know about it.  If you have saved contact fan
contact info with your account, Digger helps with the typing by filling out
text about the song that is playing, and some of what's on deck, to provide
context. </p>


<h2>Notable artistic aspects</h2>

<p>When you are listening, you might be struck by aspects of the
composition, performance, production, or other magic that is worth noting
for your future self and any fan you might be providing suggestions to.
Put these notes in the song comment field to capture them. </p>


<h2>Context</h2>

<p>Songs are recorded in a studio or at a live performance, but sometimes
there is more to it.  Fans in the know often share amusing or
illuminating anecdotes about the song background, contractual obligations,
recording situations or other info.  These anecdotes can also be put in the
comment field, but there is an opportunity here to do more.  Context might be
more stories than facts, but it's always fun to hear from fans. </p>


<h2>Relationships</h2>

<p>Great music is made by great musicians, and it can be rewarding to see
what else they have done who else they have worked with.  Some relationships
are surprising and lead to things you might not have explored otherwise.
Looking forward to developing this further. </p>


<h2>Personal connections</h2>

<p>Nothing beats directly supporting artists you like.  "I saw them live"
expresses both appreciation and commitment.  Any connection to the creative
process is great and worth sharing, including music purchases and other
items that directly benefit artists.  Most musicians don't get enough
support from streaming.  You should be able to see more of how your fans
are connecting to the music. </p>


<h2>Happenings</h2>

<p>New releases, upcoming concerts, and other happenings are important to
know about.  It's a drag missing something you would have wanted to go see.
Fans are good source, but looking forward to connecting with services to
get the scoop on what's going on. </p>


<h2>Help with setup</h2>

<p>Fans help you get started.  When you add a music fan, Digger checks their
library for songs you haven't rated yet and copies their rating info to jump
start your tuned listening experience.  When you rate your own music you
help fans discover music they want to hear.  All while you get back into
enjoying music in your library. </p>

<!--

DiggerHub collaboration walks through your active music fans in order,
checking each one to see if they can contribute default ratings for songs
you haven't rated yet.  Up to 200 rated songs are returned per call.  The
checksince attribute for each music fan is updated with either the
creation time of the last song rating contributed, or the current time if
the fan has no more song ratings left to contribute.  After
collaborations are updated, fan ratings are checked at most once a day.

If you adjust the ratings while a song is playing, the ratings are
considered yours.  If you deactivate a fan, any rating defaults they have
contributed stick around.  If you remove them, then their default rating
contributions are also removed.

When you update your active music fans, or click the info button next to an
active music fan.  Digger calls /api/mfcontrib on the hub.  If you are
running music locally, any songs not yet on the hub are uploaded so they are
available for collaboration.  If this is your first time collaborating, and
you have a lot of local music, the initial upload might take a few minutes.
After that, only newly added songs need to be uploaded.  Uploading new music
resets the checksince time for all of your music fans and restarts the
collaboration process.
