<h1>Music Fans</h1>

<p>A music fan is someone who enjoys listening to music.  Digger is for
music fans who collect songs and listen to them through the years.  Music
fans like to connect around music.  They might not always agree, but they
like learning what the other person appreciates.  Fans like to connect
around music. </p>

<p>Back in the day, when you went over to a someone's house, you might check
out their album collection, see how much you recognize, check out what you
don't recognize, and maybe talk about what you've been listening to
recently.  They might play something they think you should hear, or let you
choose something to put on.  This type of interaction didn't scale into the
digital age the way radio and mixtapes did.  There are several reasons:</p>
<ul>

<li>Casually browsing other people's music collections doesn't work anymore
because albums are no longer part of the room.  They exist on screen.

<li>Without the constraints of physical space, libraries have grown very
large.

<li>With a large collection, it takes more effort and knowledge to find
something appropriate to suggest.

</ul>

<p>Digger makes it easier to access our collections, enjoy our music, and
support music interactions like these: </p>


<h2>Have you heard...</h2>

<p>Some of the most treasured music in my collection came from people who
pointed out gems I hadn't discovered yet.  If they hadn't clued me in, I
might have missed out on music I've listened to for years since.</p>

<p>I'll usually try find whatever was suggested if I haven't heard it yet.
If it's good I'll add it to my collection. </p>


<h2>Response</h2>

<p>When I rate a song that was previously suggested to me, my impression
becomes a response, provided I thought it was better than average.  If I
thought it was at best average, then it's probably better not to bother
telling whoever suggested it that the song they like is not very good.  They
might have other suggestions that are much better.  Or I might stop paying
attention to them. </p>


<h2>Discovery</h2>

<p>When I rate a new song highly, and someone in my fan group has also rated
it highly, Digger lets them know we now have that music in common even if
they hadn't suggested it.  That helps build our connection strength and
helps them learn what kind of things I like. </p>


<h2>Path cross</h2>

<p>If I listen to a song, and in the past day or so someone else in my fan
group has also listened to the same song, or another song from the same
album, or the same artist, that can be fun to be informed about.  It's a
good excuse to get in touch with them and maybe connect more. </p>


<h2>This song is amazing!</h2>

<p>Sometimes when I listen to a song, it's just perfect at the time.  I'll
suggest it to others in my fan group who haven't heard it.  Sometimes I'll
copy my impression info and paste that into whatever social broadcast app
I'm currently using.  Or mail it to someone who isn't on Digger yet. </p>


<h2>Notable artistic aspects</h2>

<p>When I'm listening, sometimes I'm struck by aspects of the composition,
performance, production, or other magic that is worth noting for my future
self and anyone else I might be providing suggestions to.  I record these impressions in the song comments when they occur to me while I'm listening. </p>


<h2>Song stories</h2>

<p>Songs are recorded in a studio or at a live performance, but sometimes
there's more to it.  Fans in the know often share amusing or illuminating
anecdotes about the song background, contractual obligations, recording
situations or other info.  These anecdotes can also be put in the comment
field, but there is an opportunity here to do more. </p>


<h2>Artist connections</h2>

<p>Great music is made by great musicians, and it can be rewarding to see
what else they have done who else they have worked with.  Some relationships
are surprising and lead to things you might not have explored otherwise.
Looking forward to developing this further. </p>


<h2>Personal connections</h2>

<p>Nothing beats directly supporting artists you like.  "I saw them live"
expresses both appreciation and commitment.  Any connection to the creative
process is great and worth sharing, including music purchases and other
items that directly benefit artists.  Most musicians don't get enough
support from streaming.  You should be able to see more of how your fans
are connecting to the music. </p>


<h2>Happenings</h2>

<p>New releases, upcoming concerts, and other happenings are important to
know about.  It's a drag missing something you would have wanted to go see.
Fans are good source, but looking forward to connecting with services to
get the scoop on what's going on. </p>


<h2>Help with setup</h2>

<p>Fans help you get set up.  When you add a fan to your group, Digger
checks their library for songs you haven't rated yet and copies some of
their impression info to jump start your tuned listening experience.  When
you rate your own music you help fans discover music they want to hear.  All
while you get back into enjoying music in your library. </p>
