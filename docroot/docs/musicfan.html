<h1>Music Fans</h1>

<p>A music fan is someone who enjoys listening to music.  Dedicated music
fans collect music so they have it and can listen to it whenever they
want.  Digger is a tool to help dedicated music fans rate and retrieve music
from their collections, and connect with friends around music. </p>

<p>Back in the day, when you went over to a friend's house, you might look
over their album collection to see how much you recognize, check out what
you don't recognize, and maybe talk about what you've been listening to
recently.  Your friend might play something they think you should hear, or
let you choose something to play.  As music transitioned into the digital
age, concepts like radio and mixtapes adapted, but sharing around personal
collections fell by the wayside. </p>

<p>Returning to those analog days is impossible.  Even if we could somehow
return, collections have grown from hundreds of albums into thousands.
Looking through them all is starting to get a bit tedious.  To move forward,
we need to focus on the foundations of your collection.  That is, your
impressions of the music.  More specifically, the aspects of your impression
most important for collaboration and retrieval.</p>

<p>Digger is a rating and retrieval app providing automated access your
collection based on your own impressions.  Digger supports collaboration
with friends and fellow music fans through DiggerHub. </p>


<h2>Sharing and collaborating</h2>

<p>Click the Digger "share" button to copy the song Title, Artist, Album,
Keywords, Approachability and Energy Level, along with your saved personal
comment.  Send that to anyone any way you like, sharing great music improves
anyone's day and helps them get to know you better. <p>

<p>You can also collaborate through DiggerHub. </p>

<h3>1. Connect</h3>

<p>Under the "fans" section of your profile, choose "connect" to see friends
and fellow music fans you are following.  To add a friend, search for them
by their digger name.  If you haven't added any friends yet, and you want to
get a feel for how things work, click "Connect Me" to add whoever the hub
picks for you. </p>


<h3>2. Match</h3>

<p>Like recognizing album covers in your friend's collection, "match" lets
you see how many songs you and your friend have in common.  If you have
songs in your collection that you haven't rated yet, your friend provides
default rating information you can use for contextual retrieval.  The "rcv"
tab shows how many default ratings you've received.  The "snd" tab shows how
many default ratings they have received from you.  If you remove a friend,
their default ratings are also removed.  When you play a song, any default
rating information for that song becomes yours. </p>


<h3>3. Messages</h3>

<p>See what your friends have shared recently and get automatic
recommendations from your friends matching your current listening
parameters. </p>
