<h1>Digger Webserver App</h1>

<p>Digger is a web application.  When you run Digger, it first starts a
local web server, then it opens the web app in your browser.  That means you
can run it like a regular local app, or open the server on one computer and
open the web interface from another computer on the same LAN. </p>

<p>Running as server/webapp combination means that Digger on the web is
literally the same interface as Digger on your computer.  And the local
server code is the same across all platforms.  That's all great, but your
specific platform might not be used to this.  Here are some things you might
run into: </p>


<h2>Warning about running a free app you downloaded directly</h2>

<p>Proprietary operating systems like MacOS and Windows feel you should only
run applications available through their stores, which they have some
control over.  When you download Digger and run it, you might see a warning,
and if you are not already familiar with this, you might have to figure out
how to tell your computer to run the program anyway.  Instructions vary
the the OS and version, but there is always a way if you search for it.</p>

<p>The warning serves a purpose, which is to tell you to make sure you trust
the program you are about to run.  For this reason, you should only download
Digger from <a href="https://diggerhub.com/#files">DiggerHub.com</a>, or
install node.js and download the source code from
<a href="https://github.com/theriex/digger">GitHub</a>.</p>


<h2>Warning about opening browser to localhost</h2>

<p>It's odd that a personal firewall would prevent an app opening a browser
from the command line, since the server is already running, and opening a
browser to interact with it doesn't constitute a change in security.
Nevertheless this can happen.  If it does, see if you can let your firewall
know this is an ok thing to do. </p>

<p>If your personal firewall is a hassle, check the server output for a
line like:</p>
<code>
Digger v0.9.3 available at http://localhost:6980?cb=v0.9.3
</code>
<p>Copy that http address into your browser.  If you bookmark the link, you
might need to update the bookmark when you download a new version of
Digger. </p>


<h2>Anything else</h2>

<p>If you run into any other problems running
Digger <a href="https://github.com/theriex/digger/issues">add an issue</a>
so the project can try fix it. </p>
