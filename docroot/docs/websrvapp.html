<h1>Digger Webserver App</h1>

<p>Digger is a web application, so it uses a browser display as the
interface for all platforms.  When you run Digger on your computer, it
starts a local web server, then opens the web app in your browser.  It works
similarly to a standard app, but it's the same code across all platforms and
has other advantages, like running the Digger server on one computer and
accessing it with another browser on the same LAN.  Great stuff, but your
operating system might display some warnings.  Here are some of the things
you might run into: </p>


<h2>Warning about running a free app you downloaded directly:</h2>

<p>Operating systems like MacOS, Windows and others prefer you run
applications purchased through their stores, which they have some control
over.  When you run Digger, you might get a warning that it was downloaded
directly from the internet.  If you are not already familiar with how to
tell your computer to go ahead and open it anyway, you might have to look up
how to do that.  Instructions vary depending on the OS and version, but
there is always a way.</p>

<p>The warning serves a purpose, which is to tell you to make sure you trust
the program you are about to run.  Only download Digger from 
<a href="https://diggerhub.com/#files" onclick="window.open('https://diggerhub.com/#files');return false">DiggerHub.com</a>,
or install node.js and download the source code from
<a href="https://github.com/theriex/digger" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/theriex/digger');return false">GitHub</a>.</p>


<h2>Personal firewall warning:</h2>

<p>Because Digger runs as a web server, you might get a firewall notice
about whether the service should be accessible to other computers on the
same LAN.  Serving your home LAN is probably fine, serving everyone in a
public coffee shop WiFi is probably not.  If you are not sure, go with the
default firewall allowances. </p>


<h2>Can't run from temp folder:</h2>

<p>You might need to move the Digger app from your downloads folder to your
desktop or somewhere else you can easily find it and run it again later. </p>


<h2>Browser doesn't start:</h2>

<p>After the Digger server starts, it spawns a call to open Digger in your
default browser.  If that didn't come up, the command to open the browser
page didn't work.  Look for the server console window, and open the URL from
the last line. </p>

<p>If you know the command that should have been used to open a URL on your system, and would like to
help improve Digger, <a href="https://github.com/theriex/digger/issues" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/theriex/digger/issues');return false">open a GitHub issue</a> and include</p>
<ol>
<li>The command that should have been used
<li>Your operating system version
<li>The errors from the server console window
</ol>


<h2>Anything else:</h2>

<p>If you run into any other problems running
Digger <a href="https://github.com/theriex/digger/issues" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/theriex/digger/issues');return false">add an issue</a>
so the project can try fix it. </p>
