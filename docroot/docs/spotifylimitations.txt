If an album flows smoothly from one track to the next, but has separate
tracks, you are going to get a slight interruption between the tracks,
rather than the seamless experience created by the artist.

Apropos artists, they don't get paid much.

It's probably worth asking yourself if the $15/month might be better spent
purchasing a couple of albums a month and getting into those instead.

This is an online rental service.  You don't have your own copy of the
music.  Things can go away, even permanently, and you may be restricted
based on where you find yourself in the world.  You might not notice much
when something goes away, but you are losing part of your experience.
