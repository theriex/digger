<h1>Metadata Matching</h1>

<p>When saving your own song impressions on DiggerHub, the
title/artist/album fields all need to match exactly for it to be considered
the same song.  An original studio release and the live version are not the
same.  When matching between fans, an exact match is preferable, but a
soft match on title and artist is enough for default ratings or
recomendations. </p>

<h2>Soft Match</h2>

<table><tr><th>Eric has</th><th>Alice has</th></tr><tr><td>
Not Great Men (Remastered) <br/>
<em>Gang Of Four</em><br/>
Singles <br/>
</td><td>
Not Great Men <br/>
<em>Gang Of Four</em><br/>
Entertainment! <br/>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Digger ignores the parenthetical expression and matches the title and
artist for fan collaboration.</p>


<h2>No Match</h2>

<table><tr><th>Eric has</th><th>Ennio has</th></tr><tr><td>
The Great Curve <br/>
<em>Talking Heads</em><br/>
Remain In Light <br/>
</td><td>
Remain in Light/03-The Great Curve.mp3 <br/>
<em>Unknown</em><br/>
Singles <br/>
</td></tr></table>

<p>If the local song had been in a "Talking Heads" folder, then Digger would
have filled out the metadata using the path.  With no metadata and
incomplete folder structure, there's no match.  If you have files with
missing metadata, you can use a tagging tool like
<a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">MuiscBrainz Picard</a> to fix
them.  The new metadata will be read when you next play the song. </p>

<p>If you have changed quite a few files, click "Read Files" in the Digger
Library Actions to update Digger.  It might take a few minutes for the
changes to sync with DiggerHub, but after that you may find your fans
have more to contribute, and you'll have more info for them.</p>


<h2>SpId Match</h2>

<table><tr><th>Eric has</th><th>Alice has</th></tr><tr><td>
Hautoa (Warrior) <br/>
<em>Oceania</em><br/>
CD <br/>
</td><td>
Hautoa (Warrior) <br/>
<em>Jaz Coleman</em><br/>
Oceania <br/>
</td></tr></table>

<p>These songs don't match on metadata, but the semi-automated mapping of
local file metadata to Spotify database information resulted in both tracks
having the same spid value.  These songs match for fan collaboration.</p>
