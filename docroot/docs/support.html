<h1>Digger Support</h1>

<p>If you have run into an issue with Digger on any platform, consider
searching the ISSUESONGITHUB and adding a comment if found, or opening a
new issue as needed.  If you prefer, you can also contact SUPPEMAIL to
get in touch.  For sponsored development, donations, or other inquiries
contact EPINOVA. </p>


<h2>Project Principles:</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>Just press play</b>: Play your music by mixing and tuning.  Support
search but don't require it.

<li><b>Trustable OPENSOURCE</b>: See how Digger works and what it does.

<li><b>Minimal data</b>: Save only what is needed for song impressions,
collaboration, and authentication.

<li><b>All about the music</b>: Collaborate directly from personal music
impressions.  Leave chat to social connection venues.

<li><b>Respect for music</b>: Enhance music library access.  Don't modify
music files.  Support and add value for artists and vendors.

<li><b>Opt-in hub</b>: Support running standalone, or with no network
connection.
</ul>
