<h2>Digger Project Principles:</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>Just press play</b>: Set your filters and enjoy your music.  Support
album playback, search, history, deck tuning and other features for active
listening.

<li><b>Trustable OPENSOURCE</b>: See how Digger works and what it does.

<li><b>Minimal data</b>: Save only what is needed for song impressions,
authentication, and structured collaboration.  Leave chat to social media or
personal communications.

<li><b>Respect for music</b>: Enhance music library access.  Don't modify
music files.  Support and add value for artists and vendors.

<li><b>Optional hub</b>: Support running standalone, or with no network
connection.
</ul>

<p>Digger is sponsored by EPINOVA. </p>
