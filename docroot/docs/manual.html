<h1>The Digger Manual</h1>

<p>Digger is a music library tool optimized for retrieval and collaboration.
Its name references DJs digging through the record library stacks pulling
albums to play.  Its interface borrows from vintage recording hardware to
provide intuitive control.  It works like a mixer for your music
collection.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of Digger is to get noise in the room without having
to think too much.  Tune the filter controls for what you want to hear.
Adjust the player controls to reflect what you feel.</p>


<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>When you first start Digger, it reads your library to start playing.  If
you are on the web it pulls from your music service.  If you are running
locally, it scans your Music folder.  If you don't have a Music folder, or
you keep your music in a different location, you can configure that in the
Library Actions section of the <a href="#toppanel">top panel</a>.</p>

<p>Whether you run Digger locally or on the web (or both), it's the same
interface.  The local server syncs to the web when you sign in.  By
default your local server runs
at <a href="http://localhost:6980">http://localhost:6980</a>.  If you need to change that see <a href="#digcfg">local files configuration</a>.</p>


<h2>The Player Panel</h2>

<p>The player panel is where you control music playback, and record what you
feel.  The main controls are the energy level and approachability pan knobs
just under the transport.  These are impression controls you use based on
what they mean to you.  Whether you think of "Amped" as
heads-down-amps-on-10, high BPM, massive technical prowess, fireworks and/or
whatever else, that's how you think of it.  Likewise whether "Chill" means
sleep, relaxation, meditation and/or whatever else, that's what you think of
it.  Approachability is similarly up to you.  "Hard" might typically be
characterized by dissonance, difficult sounds, tough lyrics or other aspects
you consider challenging.  "Easy" might typically tend more towards
consonant, nice, generally approachable stuff.  Your call.</p>

<p>Energy level and approachability have nothing to do with whether a song
is good or not.  That's what the rating stars are for.  Obviously everything
in your collection is already above average or you wouldn't have bothered
collecting it, so 3 stars is kind of the default.  That gives you some
leeway for noting if a song is among your best, or maybe not as much.</p>

<p>Keyword toggles let you mark the song for retrieval, either by situation or
category.  Keywords combine with energy level and approachability when
digging for music to play.  For example you might select "Social" for songs
you are comfortable playing when having people over, then adjust energy
level and approachability as appropriate for the situation.  Click the '+'
button to the left to expand all keywords and/or add more.  See the 
<a href="#kwddesc">default keyword descriptions</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Use the comment button if you need to make a statement about the song.
The snooze button will pause playback after the song finishes.</p>

<p>The skip button in the upper right skips to the next song.  The tuning
fork to the left of that brings up additional song details and playback
options.  Generally a song is eligible to play once every 24hrs.  If you
find a song is being suggested too often, select "Tired" under the tuning
options to reduce the eligibility to once every 3 months.  If you click skip
again after that it moves to every 6 months.  Skip it again and it's once a
year.  By design, Digger always grabs the oldest stuff first so you might
not need this, but it's good to have when you do.</p>


<h2>The Filters Panel</h2>

<p>The filters panel controls how Digger pulls from your library.  The
Energy Level and Approachability range controls each have a slider on the
left to change the width of the retrieval range, and a slider at the bottom
to adjust the position of the retrieval range.  The dots in the middle of
each range control corresponds to the center knob positions in the
player.</p>

<p>The keyword bowtie toggles allow you to specify whether songs being
retrieved should, or should not, include the given keyword.  The middle
position is neutral.  Four selection keywords are active at any time.  You
can select which ones in the top panel library actions.</p>

<p>The rating stars represent the minimum rating required.</p>

<p>The default "Include Untagged" keyword filtering should work for most
situations.  Change this if you want to explicitely look for songs without
any associated keywords, or for songs with at least one associated
keyword.</p>

<p>By default, frequency filtering "Fq" is on.  If you want to retrieve
things regardless of when they were last played, you can switch this off.
Be aware songs could repeat weirdly.  You can also turn off all filtering
completely in the deck panel if you are having trouble searching.</p>


<h2>The Deck Panel</h2>

<p>The deck panel shows matching songs that are set to play next.  If you
change filter settings, what's on deck gets rebuilt.  The filtering bypass
toggle on the left allows you to completely turn off all filtering, which is
handy if you are just trying to search for something specific in your
collection.</p>

<p>The search box will match text anywhere in the song, even your comments.
Remember to turn off the filtering if you are searching for something you
might have played recently or if you are unsure of the rating values.</p>

<p>To the right of search are three toggles for alternate displays.  The
info button gives details on how songs are being filtered.  The album view
switches to showing all songs on the album, regardless of filtering.  In
album view, songs play from one track to the next.  The history view shows
you what you've played so far in case you want to play something again.</p>

<p>Clicking a song in the deck display brings up deck transport controls for
that song.  These allow you to play the song immediately, move it to the top
of the deck, skip it, or snooze it (mark as tired and skip).  Click the link
again to dismiss the deck transport controls.</p>


<h2 id="toppanel">The Top Panel</h2>

<p>The top panel has your account actions link on the left, library actions
and export icons on the right.</p>

<h3>Account Actions</h3>

<p>If you are running locally, the account actions link will say "Digger"
until you have signed in.  It is not required to connect the local server to
DiggerHub, but connecting will sync your data and allow for collaborating
with music friends.</p>

<p>Music friends are helpful.  If a friend has player information for songs
you haven't rated yet, they contribute their ratings to help you get
started.  If you are using a streaming web music service, friends suggest
songs from their library matching your filters.  You add friends by their
email address.  You can have up to four friends actively collaborating with
you at any time.</p>


<h3>Library Actions</h3>

<p>The library actions display shows general info about your music library,
which varies depending on if you are using Digger on the web or with local
files.  The "Choose Keywords" button lets you select which four keywords to
use for filtering and in what order they should be displayed.  You can remove
keywords you don't want to use anymore.</p>

<p>With Digger on the web, the information display shows when your streaming
service was last checked for song import.  If it's been a while, you can
click that link to check the service again.  With Digger on local files,
click the "Read Files" button to re-read everything.  To ignore non-music
subfolders while reading, add them to your "Ignore Folders".</p>

<p>For more information on configuring Digger with local files,
see <a href="#digconf">local files configuration</a> below.</p>


<h3>Export</h3>

<p>The export screen lets you make a playlist out of the songs you currently
have on deck.  So you can leverage Digger's retrieval capabilities and deck
transport adjustments to make selections of songs available to other people.
On the web, the playlist is written to your music service.  For local files,
Digger creates an m3u file and optionally copies associated music files to
your export folder.</p>


<h2 id="kwddesc">Default Keyword Descriptions</h2>

<p>The default keywords have been chosen and tested over a period of years
to provide positive and negative selection power in a wide variety of
situations.  The goal is to minimize the number of keywords in play while
covering most common music playing situations.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Social</em>: Music I might select to play when other people are listening.
<li><em>Personal</em>: Music I might select to play when it's just me listening.
<li><em>Office</em>: Music that you can listen to while you work.
<li><em>Dance</em>: Music you would dance to.
<li><em>Ambient</em>: Music that can be listened to from zero to full attention, transitioning from and to silence.
<li><em>Jazz</em>: However you define it for your collection.
<li><em>Classical</em>: However you define it for your collection.
<li><em>Talk</em>: Spoken word.
<li><em>Solstice</em>: Holiday seasonal.
</ul>


<h2 id="digcfg">Digger Local Files Configuration</h2>

<p>To change where Digger should read your music files from, open the
Library Actions in the top panel, then click either the "Music Files" or
"Digger Data" links to restart Digger in config mode.  In config mode, you
can set where to find your music files, and/or put your Digger database file
somewhere other than your home folder.  Since browsers are not generally
allowed to access your local file system, you'll have to modify the paths
directly as text.</p>

<p>You can change other details of how Digger runs locally by modifying
.digger_config.json in your home folder.  If you ever need to reset Digger
to its default settings, delete this file and Digger will recreate it from
its default setup.  The configuration settings are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>port</em>: Which port the local server should run on.
<li><em>musicPath</em>: The directory where your music files can be found.
<li><em>dbPath</em>: The file to store your Digger data.
<li><em>exPath</em>: The directory to write playlists to.
<li><em>cachePath</em>: Where Digger should store temporary download info.
</ul>

<p>The "spawn" section contains contains information about the command to
open a browser when Digger starts up.  The subsections are organized based
on the platform key as returned by
<code>node require("os").platform()</code> e.g. "darwin" for MacOS.  You can
change the startup command that gets run if you understand the structure.
So you can open a specific browser or run a script.</p>

<p>The "acctsinfo" contains your account information after you have signed
in to DiggerHub from local Digger.  It's best not to modify this part
directly.  It also has your email address and access token, so don't share
your .digger_config.json with others.</p>


<h2>Local Files Digger Hub Sync</h2>

<p>If you have signed in to DiggerHub, Digger synchronizes your local song
data with data saved on the site.  This is handy as a backup, and great if
you also run Digger from the web or from another computer.</p>

<p>The initial synchronization process can sometimes take a while, depending
on how much song data you have.  Once the initial sync is done, it's usually
very quick.  You'll notice the "hub" indicator light displayed on the player
panel while sync is ongoing.  Clicking the indicator link will open the
library actions where the "Hub Sync" line shows how many songs have been
uploaded and downloaded.  The status display shows "init", "processing",
"scheduled", or (hopefully not) an error message.  The "Reset" link can be
used to restart hubsync if you suspect it might have hung up due to network
issues or whatever.</p>
