<h1>The Digger Manual</h1>

<p>Digger is a music library tool for retrieval and collaboration.  It works
like a mixer for your music collection. </p>


<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>When you first start Digger, it reads and saves song information from
your library and starts playing music.  Digger does not modify your music
files or library.  If you sign in, song impressions you save in Digger will
be synchronized across your devices. </p>


<h2>The Player Panel</h2>

<p>The player panel holds transport control and song tuning options.  The
main controls are the <em>Energy Level</em> and <em>Approachability</em> pan
knobs.  Whether you think of "Amped" as heads-down-amps-on-10, high BPM,
massive technical prowess, fireworks and/or whatever else, that's how you
think of it.  Likewise whether "Chill" means sleep, relaxation, meditation
or whatever, that's what you think of that.  You might think of "Hard" as
dissonance, harsh sounds, tough lyrics or other challenging aspects.  By
contrast "Easy" might be consonance, familiar sounds, general
approachability.  Whatever you feel.</p>

<p>Everything in your collection is already above average or you wouldn't
have bothered collecting it, but some songs are a bit better or worse
relative to the rest.  Adjust the rating stars above or below 3 if you want
to capture that. </p>

<p>Keyword toggles let you mark the song for retrieval, either by situation or
category.  Keywords combine with energy level and approachability when
digging for music to play.  For example you might select "Social" for songs
you are comfortable playing when having people over, then adjust energy
level and approachability as appropriate for the situation.  Click the '+'
button to the left to expand all keywords and/or add more. </p>

<p>Use the comment button to save a statement about the song.  The share
button copies song details to share with other music fans.  The snooze
button will pause playback after the song finishes.</p>

<p>The skip button in the upper right skips to the next song.  Generally a
song is eligible to play once every 24hrs, but the tuning fork to the left
of skip brings up additional song details and playback options.  If you find
a song is being suggested too often, select "Tired" under the tuning options
to reduce the eligibility to once every 3 months.  If you click skip again
after that, eligibility moves to every 6 months.  Skip it again and it's
once a year.  By design, Digger always grabs oldest stuff first, so you
might not need this, but it can be handy for overplayed classic songs. </p>

<p>In the tuning options, you can fix incorrect Title, Artist, or Album
values.  Any changes are saved with your rating and do not affect the
original song file metadata. </p>

<p>You can click the keys next to the Album or Artist fields to associate
the current song keywords with all songs on the album or by the artist. </p>


<h2>The Filters Panel</h2>

<p>Filters control how Digger pulls songs from your collection.  First among
these are the Approachability and Energy Level range selectors.  Watch the
bright part of each display to see the acceptable range of what you want to
listen to.  All unrated songs are in the middle. </p>

<p>Keyword toggles allow you to specify whether songs being retrieved
should, or should not, include the given keyword.  Off is neutral.  Four
selection keywords can be active at any time.  You can select which ones in
the top panel library actions.</p>

<p>"Standard" retrieval means songs that are 2.5 stars (the default rating)
or higher.  Toggle this setting to pull higher rated or include more depth.
The default "Include Untagged" keyword filtering should work for most
situations.  Change this if you want to explicitely look for songs without
any associated keywords, or for songs with at least one associated
keyword.</p>

<p>By default, frequency filtering "Fq" is on.  If you want to retrieve
songs regardless of when they were last played, you can switch this off.  Be
aware songs might repeat weirdly.  You can also completely switch off all
filtering in the deck panel to search everything without filtering.</p>


<h2>The Deck Panel</h2>

<p>The deck panel shows matching songs ready to play next.  If you change
filter settings, the songs on deck get rebuilt.  Search matches all song
text and your comments.  If you don't find what you are searching for,
temporarily bypass all filtering using the filter toggle to the left of the
search box. </p>

<p>To the right of search, there are three display toggles: The Info button
gives details on how songs are being filtered.  The Album button switches to
play all available songs from the album in sequence regardless of filtering.
The Views button shows History (previously played songs), Newest (most
recently added to your collection), and Dupes (other copies of the currently
playing song). </p>

<p>Clicking a song on deck brings up contextual deck transport controls.
You can play the song immediately, move it to the top of the deck, skip it,
or snooze it (mark as tired and skip). </p>


<h2 id="toppanel">The Top Panel</h2>

<p>The top panel provides DiggerHub access and library actions. </p>

<h3>DiggerHub</h3>

<p>Connecting to DiggerHub synchronizes your song ratings and enables
structured collaboration with fellow music fans you select.  When you join,
your ratings are kept in sync across multiple devices.  Any time you want,
you can check what you have in common, get recommendations for music you
don't have, and even fill default ratings, from people whose musical
listening interests and reactions you respect and enjoy. </p>

<p>When you first sign in, the initial synchronization process can sometimes
take a while, depending on how much song data you have.  After the initial
sync is done, hub sync is generally very quick.  The "hub" indicator light
is displayed on the player panel while sync is ongoing.  Clicking the
indicator link will open the library actions where the "Hub Sync" line shows
how many songs have been uploaded and downloaded.  The status display shows
"init", "processing", "scheduled", or (hopefully not) an error message.  The
"Reset" link can be used to restart hubsync if you suspect it might have
hung up due to network issues or whatever.</p>

<p>DiggerHub is all about the music and your reactions to it.  Everything
you need you've already entered into Digger while you were listening. </p>


<h3>Library Actions</h3>

<p>The library actions display shows general info and actions related to the
songs you currently have on the device you are currently using. </p>

<p>"Read Files" will re-read all the music you have available.  Digger does
this automatically when it starts up to check if music has been added or
removed since last time, but you can re-read anytime if something
changed. </p>

<div class="pconly">
<p>"Ignore Folders" are names of folders in your music collection folder
that Digger should skip when reading files.  A few common folders are
already provided, but you can add more as needed.  Folder names can end with
an end with an asterisk ('*') wildcard to save typing. </p>
</div>

<p>"Choose Keywords" to select which keywords to use for filtering and in
what order they should be displayed.  You can remove keywords you don't want
to use anymore.</p>

<p>The default keywords have been chosen and tested over a period of years
to provide positive and negative selection power in a wide variety of
situations.  The goal is to minimize the number of keywords you have to fill
out while rating music, but maintain excellent retrieval capabilities
covering most common music playing situations.  The default keywords are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Social</em>: Music I might select to play when other people are listening.
<li><em>Personal</em>: Music I might select to play when it's just me listening.
<li><em>Office</em>: Songs I listen to while working.
<li><em>Dance</em>: Music to move to.
<li><em>Ambient</em>: Music that can be listened to from zero to full attention, transitioning from and to silence.
<li><em>Jazz</em>: However you define it for your collection.
<li><em>Classical</em>: However you define it for your collection.
<li><em>Talk</em>: Spoken word.
<li><em>Solstice</em>: Winter holiday seasonal.  Whatever you celebrate.
</ul>

<p>As an example of how these work, you can synthesize "Party" from
"Social", matching the Approachability and Energy Level as appropriate for
the situation and perhaps switching on "Dance" later.  Keywords like
"Morning", "Workout", "Commute" etc have fallen by the wayside over time in
favor of range controls and more generally useful keys.  Genre categories in
particular can get seriously tedious if there are too many, so go broad for
maximum leverage. </p>


<div class="pconly">
<h2 id="digcfg">Local Files Configuration</h2>

<p>Digger runs as a web app communicating with a local webserver accessed at
http://localhost:6980 by default.  You can configure this, and where to find
your music files by clicking "Music Files" or "Digger Data" links to restart
Digger in config mode.  In config mode, you can set where to find your music
files, and/or put your Digger database file somewhere other than your home
folder.  Since browsers are not generally allowed to access your local file
system, you'll have to modify these paths directly as text.</p>

<p>To change other details of how Digger runs, modify .digger_config.json in
your home folder.  The configuration settings are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>port</em>: Which port the local server should run on.
<li><em>musicPath</em>: The directory where your music files can be found.
<li><em>dbPath</em>: The file to store your Digger data.
<li><em>exPath</em>: The directory to write playlists to.
</ul>

<p>The "spawn" section contains contains information about the command to
open a browser when Digger starts up.  The subsections are organized based
on the platform key as returned by
<code>node require("os").platform();</code> - e.g. "darwin" for MacOS.  You
can change the startup command that gets run if you understand the
structure, for example to open a specific browser or run a script.</p>

<p>The "acctsinfo" contains your account information after you have signed
in to DiggerHub from local Digger.  It's best not to modify this part
directly.  Do not share your <em>.digger_config.json</em> with others since
it has your email address and access token.</p>

<p>If you ever need to reset Digger to its default settings, delete this
file and Digger will recreate it from its default setup. </p>
