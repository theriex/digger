<h1>The Digger Manual</h1>

<div class="taglinediv">Everything you might ever need to know about how
Digger works. </div>


<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>Where Digger finds your music</h2>
  <div class="platoptsdiv">
    <div class="ios">

<p>After you grant permission to access your music, Digger makes an
<code>MPMediaQuery</code> to ask iOS for all songs available.  To copy songs
onto your device, use <em>Apple Music</em> to sync all or part of your
collection from your computer. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="droid">

<p>After you grant permission to access your music, Digger queries the
Android <code>MediaStore</code> for available music audio.  To copy songs
onto your device, use the <em>Android File Transfer</em> app from your
computer. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="node">

<p>Digger creates <code>.digger_config.json</code> in your home directory
with <code>musicPath</code> set to the <code>Music</code> folder.  To change
where Digger should find your music, tap the library button
(<img class="manimg" src="../img/recordcrate.png"/>) at the top center of
the app and choose <em>"Music Files"</em> to set where Digger should look.
If there are folders Digger should avoid, use the <em>"Ignore Folders"</em>
button under the library options.  Folder names can end with an asterisk
('*') wildcard. </p>

<p>Digger relies on song file metadata for search and sync.  While it may be
able to guess missing metadata from an <code>Artist/Album/Song</code> file
organization, any missing metadata in your collection should be fixed using
a tool for that purpose.  Each song must have a title and artist.  Digger
does not modify your song files. </p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>Where Digger saves your song info</h2>
  <div class="platoptsdiv">
    <div class="ios">

<p>Digger saves your ratings and annotations in the app. Tap the "Digger"
link in the upper left of the app to connect to DiggerHub for backup and
sync across multiple devices. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="droid">

<p>Digger saves your ratings and annotations in the app. Tap the "Digger"
link in the upper left of the app to connect to DiggerHub for backup and
sync across multiple devices. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="node">

<p>Digger saves your song info as <code>digdat.json</code> in your home
folder. To change where Digger saves, tap the library button at the top
center of the app and choose <code>Digger Data</code>.  Tap the "Digger"
link in the upper left of the app to connect to DiggerHub for backup and
sync across multiple devices. </p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>Albums, Deck and Search</h2>
  <div>

<p>Digger initially starts in <img class="manimg"
src="../img/album.png"/> (Album) mode with suggestions active.  To play
individual songs, switch to <img class="manimg" src="../img/deck.png"/>
(Deck) mode.  To find something specific, use <img class="manimg"
src="../img/search.png"/> (Search).  Song playback follows either album or
deck order, depending on which is active. </p>

<p>Songs on deck and suggested albums lean towards what you have least
recently heard.  Digger goes deep through your collection stacks to pull
what you probably want to hear next. </p>

  </div>
</div>


<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>Noting your impression</h2>
  <div>

<p>Digger is designed to note your impressions intuitively, with minimized
distraction and possible enhancement of your listening experience.  All songs
default as average.  Adjust as you see fit whenever you like. </p>

<p><img class="manlgimg" src="../docs/illuKnobEL.png"/>
Perhaps <em>"Chill"</em> reflects how you find this song slow, quiet, or
relaxing.  Maybe <em>"Amped"</em> indicates it's fast, loud, or activating.
Adjust as you like. </p>

<p><img class="manlgimg" src="../docs/illuKnobAL.png"/>
Perhaps <em>"Easy"</em> reflects how you find this song soothing, consonant
or simple. Maybe <em>"Hard"</em> indicates it's challenging, dissonant, or
complex.  Whatever you feel. </p>

<p><img class="manlgimg" src="../docs/illuKwToggles.png"/> Toggle keywords
to associate a song with common listening situations.  Hit the '+' button to
add a keyword.  The default tags have been chosen through trials to yield
excellent selection power; for example the <code>"Social"</code> keyword,
combined with Energy Level and Approachability range settings can pull
appropriate music for everything from a relaxed brunch to a high energy
party. </p>

<p><img class="manmdimg" src="../docs/illuStars.png"/> The star bar lets you
mark a song better or worse relative to your collection.  Everything in your
collection is worth keeping, but if it's a personal anthem or
underwhelming album filler, this is what to adjust. </p>

<p>If you have something to note, the <img class="manimg"
src="../img/comment.png"/> comment button opens text space suitable for a
sentence or two.  Longer stories and discussions are best posted separately.
Links in comments might not be clickable on all platforms.  Comment text is
searchable within Digger. </p>

<p>The <img class="manimg" src="../img/share.png"/> share button copies all
information about a song, including your annotations, to DiggerHub or the
clipboard for sharing with others.  The <img class="manimg"
src="../img/sleep.png"/> sleep button is an extended transport control
allowing you to pause playback when a song ends. </p>

<div class="subtopicdiv">
  <h3><img class="manimg" src="../img/tunefork.png"/> Tuning Options</h3>
  <div>

<p>The tuning fork in the upper right of the player panel provides detailed
song information and advanced rating actions. </p>

<p>Digger selects any song at most once in 24 hours and prefers least
recently played.  If a song seems suggested too often, marking
it <code>Tired</code> switches the playback frequency from
<code>'P'</code> (playable) to <code>'B'</code> (backburner) meaning it will
be played at most once every 90 days.  Skipping a backburner song makes it
a <code>'Z'</code> (sleeper) that plays at most once every 180 days.
Skipping a sleeper song marks it <code>'O'</code> (overplayed) and eligible
to be selected once a year. If a song has played enough for this lifetime, or
if it doesn't stand on its own outside of the album, <code>"Don't
Suggest"</code> disqualifies it from selection.</p>

<p>Digger automatically marks duplicate songs played so you don't get an
album song suggested again from a compilation.  Dupes are checked via song
metadata, so a remix or a separate album release might still be
suggested. <img class="manmdimg" src="../docs/illuKeysToAlbum.png"/> adds or
overwrites all currently selected keywords to all songs on the album.
<img class="manmdimg" src="../docs/illuMarkAlbumTired.png"/> marks all album
songs tired.  </p>

<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>Filtering songs for continuous selection</h2>
  <div>

<p>Your song impressions directly drive continuous selection, following the
playback filters you can adjust anytime. </p>

<p><img class="manrcimg" src="../docs/illuApproachability.png"/>
Adjust <em>Approachability</em> window width and position using its x/y
positioning track.  Double tap to reset. </p>

<p><img class="manrcimg" src="../docs/illuEnergyLevel.png"/>
Adjust <em>Energy Level</em> window width and position using its x/y
positioning track.  Double tap to reset. </p>

<p><img class="manlgimg" src="../docs/illuKwFilters.png"/> Filter on up 4
keywords at once.  Each active keyword has a 3-way toggle to specify if
matching songs <em>must</em> have the keyword, must <em>not</em> have the
keyword, or not specified.  Tap the keys icon to choose which keywords are
active and in what order.  The default keywords are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Social</em>: Playable in gatherings with other people.
<li><em>Personal</em>: Special to you.
<li><em>Office</em>: Appropriate while working.
<li><em>Dance</em>: Music to move to.
<li><em>Ambient</em>: Transitionable from and to silence, listenable at different attention levels.
<li><em>Jazz</em>: As applied to your collection.
<li><em>Classical</em>: As applied to your collection.
<li><em>Talk</em>: Spoken word, conversational attention.
<li><em>Solstice</em>: Seasonal holiday.  Whatever/whenever you celebrate.
</ul>

<p>Keywords like <em>"Morning"</em>, <em>"Workout"</em>, <em>"Commute"</em>
and others were obviated by range controls and general tags.  Specific genre
categories can get tedious, but may be useful for some collections. </p>

<p><img class="manmdimg"
src="../docs/illuStarFilter.png"/> <em>"Standard"</em> means 2.5 stars or
higher, including all songs that have not had their rating value adjusted
from the default initial value.  Tap this 5-way toggle to adjust the
minimum star level for playback. </p>

<p><img class="manmdimg" src="../docs/illuTagFilter.png"/> <em>"Allow
Untagged"</em> is normal keyword filtering.  If you only want songs without
any associated keywords, you can change this to <em>"Untagged Only"</em>.
The opposite of that is <em>"Tagged Only"</em>. </p>

<p><img class="manmdimg" src="../docs/illuFq.png"/> Frequency filtering is
normally on, meaning that Digger will not suggest a song if it was played
too recently.  If you've run out of music on deck, you can use this toggle
to see which songs would otherwise have been eligible. </p>

  </div>
</div>


<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>Viewing and tuning songs on deck</h2>
  <div>

<p><img class="manimg" src="../img/history.png"/> switches the display to
songs you have previously played. </p>

<p><img class="manimg" src="../img/info.png"/> overlays a summary of how
many songs passed each of the filtering stages.

<p>Tap any song on deck to show an action bar where you can: </p>

<table class="manicotable">
  <tr><td><img class="manimginv" src="../img/play.png"/></td>
    <td>Play the song immediately.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img class="manimginv" src="../img/snooze.png"/></td>
    <td>Mark the song tired and skip.</td></tr>
</table>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>Library  actions</h2>
  <div>

<p>The <img class="manlgimg" src="../img/recordcrate.png"/> button at the
top center provides general information and actions.  You can switch
between <em>Light</em> and <em>Dark</em> display modes here. </p>

<p>The <em>"Carry"</em> button provides library maintenance information.  If
you are running Digger on a device with access to all of your music files,
select <em>Permanent Collection</em>.  If you are running with only a
downloaded subset of your music collection choose <em>Local Copy</em>. </p>

<p>Digger will suggest offloading any album with no 4+ star tracks,
displaying a badness percentage of songs that are 2 stars or less.  Since
you've recorded your impressions and are unlikely to want to listen to the
album again, you may want to delete it.  For local copy, Digger may
also suggest offloading tired albums on the assumption you can copy the
album back from your permanent collection later.  Tap the album name to
play it or view details. </p>

<p>To suggest downloads, Digger checks your ratings on DiggerHub against
what is on your device.  If there is more than one song rating for an album,
then it will be found with <em>Albums</em> selected. <em>Singles</em> are
fetched separately to avoid cluttering up the album suggestions.  General
filtering is not supported in hub queries, but you can choose a keyword for
more focused download suggestions.  Digger may occasionally suggest
downloading music you already have due to differences in album title or
artist name metadata.  If this happens, tap the album name to let the hub
know you already have it, or just not to suggest it. </p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>DiggerHub</h2>
  <div>

<p>Tap the "Digger" link in the upper left to sign in or join. Connecting to
DiggerHub will sync your song impressions to the hub and back out to all
devices where you run Digger. </p>

<p>After signing in, whenever you play a song or adjust your impression of
it, you may notice a "hub" communication indicator light briefly in the
player panel display.  Normally the amount of data sent to save a rating is
around 0.0005mb so it is barely noticeable, but if you've been running
Digger offline for a really long time, or if you are restoring your ratings
to a new device, the "hub" indicator light might stay on while sync
completes.  Tap it to view progress details. </p>

<p>DiggerHub also provides optional structured song rating information.
Essentially two DiggerHub users can collaborate through similarities and
differences in their music collections and their song impressions.  Another
option is to receive a weekly report detailing what your top 20 songs were,
so you can share with others who might be interested what you've been
listening to recently. </p>
