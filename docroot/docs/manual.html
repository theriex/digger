<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>Where Digger finds your music</h2>
  <div class="platoptsdiv">
    <div class="ios">

<p>After you grant permission to access your music, Digger uses an
<code>MPMediaQuery</code> to ask iOS for all songs available for apps on
your device.  To copy songs onto your device, use <em>Apple Music</em> to
sync all or part of your collection from your computer. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="droid">

<p>After you grant permission to access your music, Digger queries the
Android <code>MediaStore</code> for available music audio.  To copy songs
onto your device, use the <em>Android File Transfer</em> app from your
computer. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="node">

<p>Digger creates <code>.digger_config.json</code> in your home directory
with a default <code>musicPath</code> set to the <code>Music</code> folder
off your home directory.  To change where Digger should find music, click
the library button (<img class="manimg" src="../img/recordcrate.png"/>) at
the top center of the app, then choose <em>"Music Files"</em> to set where
Digger should look.  If there are folders Digger should avoid, use
the <em>"Ignore Folders"</em> button under the library options to tell
Digger what to skip over. Folder names can end with an asterisk ('*')
wildcard. </p>

<p>Digger relies on song file metadata for search and sync.  While it may be
able to guess missing metadata from an <code>Artist/Album/Song</code> file
organization, any missing metadata in your collection should be fixed using
a tool for that purpose.  Each song must have a title and artist.  Digger
does not modify your song files. </p>

<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>Autoplay, Albums and Search</h2>
  <div>

<p>On first launch, Digger starts with the <img class="manimg"
src="../img/album.png"/> (Album) display and provides suggestions.  If
you have something else in mind, use the <img class="manimg"
src="../img/search.png"/> (Search) display.  To play individual songs, use
the <img class="manimg" src="../img/deck.png"/> (Deck) display.  After
initial launch, the app resumes whichever display you were last in.  The
song to play next follows the display you have active. </p>

<p>Digger always prefers what you have least recently heard, so it will dig
through the stacks in your collection and pull things you might want to hear
next.  As you listen, you can annotate what's playing, then you can reference
your annotations for selecting songs. </p>

  </div>
</div>


<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>Annotating a song</h2>
  <div>

<p>Digger annotations capture an almost complete picture of your impression
of a song, saving a rating that can be used for music retrieval.  You record
your impression using the feel knobs, keyword toggles, star bar and comment
entry. </p>

<p><img class="manlgimg" src="../docs/illuKnob.png"/> Feel knobs let you
position a song along a dimension of the music universe.  Digger supports
two dimensions: <em>Approachability</em> and <em>Energy Level</em>.  How you
position each of these knobs depends entirely on your feelings and what the
values mean to you.  Perhaps <em>"Easy"</em> might reflect soothing,
consonance, or simplicity whereas <em>"Hard"</em> might indicate
challenging, dissonance, or complexity.  Perhaps <em>"Chill"</em> might
reflect slow, quiet, or relaxing, whereas <em>"Amped"</em> might indicate
fast, loud, or activating.  Whatever you feel. </p>

<p><img class="mansmimg" src="../docs/illuKwToggles.png"/> Keyword toggles
let you mark a song for retrieval using categorical and situational tags.
The default tags have been chosen through trials to yield excellent
selection power for minimum data entry.  As an example
the <code>"Social"</code> keyword, with a feel knob value, can mark
presentation music from a low key brunch to an energetic party.  Expand the
keyword toggles to see or add more. </p>

<p><img class="manmdimg" src="../docs/illuStars.png"/> The star bar lets you
reflect if a song is better or less than average for your collection.  The
expectation is everything in your collection was worth keeping, so lower
rated songs are typically less impressive tracks from otherwise notable
albums, and top rated songs could be personal anthems. </p>

<p>The <img class="manimg" src="../img/comment.png"/> comment button opens
text input for your notes about a song or what it means to you.  Digger
comments are a sentence or short paragraph, if a song merits a longer
discussion or story, that's best posted separately.  You can include a URL
in your comment, but it may not be clickable in the app.  All text in
comments is available to search, so words and phrases you write work for
search. </p>

<p>The <img class="manimg" src="../img/share.png"/> share button copies all
information about the song, including your annotations, to DiggerHub or to
the clipboard for sharing using whatever social tech you like.  The
<img class="manimg" src="../img/sleep.png"/> sleep button is an extended
transport control allowing you to pause playback after a song finishes. </p>

<div class="expandiv">
  <h3><img class="manimg" src="../img/tunefork.png"/> Tuning Options</h3>
  <div>

<p>Digger won't generally play a song that was previously played within 24
hours, but some songs might still feel like they get pulled too often.  By
marking a song as <code>Tired</code>, the playback frequency switches from
<code>'P'</code> (playable) to <code>'B'</code> (backburner) meaning it will
be played at most once every 90 days.  If you skip a backburner song it
automatically moves to <code>'Z'</code> (sleeper) and plays at most once
every 180 days.  If you skip a sleeper song it moves to <code>'O'</code>
(overplayed) and is eligible to play once a year. </p>

<p>If a song has autoplayed enough for a lifetime, or if it doesn't stand on
its own outside of its album context, <code>"Don't Suggest"</code> will
disqualify it from autoplay selection.</p>

<p>If the keywords you've selected for the currently playing song can be
applied to all songs on the album, <img class="manimg"
src="../img/keys.png"/>&#x21e8;&nbsp;<em>Album</em> will add or overwrite
those keywords across all album songs. </p>

<p>The tuning display also shows the source of the currently playing song,
the last playback time (if previously played), and a dupes count (if dupes
are found).  Digger marks duplicate songs as played so you don't get the
same song repeatedly suggested from a compilation, the original album, and
wherever else.  Dupe tracking works off matching song metadata, so Digger
might still pull the remix version of a song even if you played the
original. </p>

<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>Filtering songs for playback</h2>
  <div>

<p>In Deck playback mode, Digger shows the song retrieval filters and the
selected songs "on deck" for playback.  The retrieval filters determine
currently acceptable knob values, keywords, and rating stars across songs in
your collection. </p>

<p><img class="manlgimg" src="../docs/illuRangeCtrl.png"/> 2D range
selectors allow you to specify an acceptable Feel Knob range and bounding
using a single motion.  All songs that have not been feel adjusted are in
the center. </p>

<p><img class="manlgimg" src="../docs/illuKwFilters.png"/> You can filter on
up to 4 active keywords at once.  To select which keywords are currently
active for retrieval, click <em>"Choose Keywords"</em> under the library
actions (<img class="manimg" src="../img/recordcrate.png"/>) at the top
center of the app.  Each active keyword has an associated 3-way toggle
allowing you to specify if matching songs <em>must</em> have the keyword,
must <em>not</em> have the keyword, or off (may or may not have the
keyword). </p>

<div class="expandiv">
  <h3><img class="manimg" src="../img/keys.png"/> Default Keywords</h3>
  <div>

<p>"Choose Keywords" under the library actions lets you select which
keywords to use for filtering and in what order they should be displayed.
You can also remove keywords you don't want to use anymore. </p>

<p>The default keywords have been chosen and tested over a period of years
to provide excellent retrieval capabilities with minimum required tagging.
The default keywords are: </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Social</em>: Playable in gatherings with other people.
<li><em>Personal</em>: Special to you.
<li><em>Office</em>: Appropriate while working.
<li><em>Dance</em>: Music to move to.
<li><em>Ambient</em>: Transitionable from or to silence. Listenable at various attention levels.
<li><em>Jazz</em>: As applied to your collection.
<li><em>Classical</em>: As applied to your collection.
<li><em>Talk</em>: Spoken word, conversational attention.
<li><em>Solstice</em>: Seasonal holiday.  Whatever you celebrate.
</ul>

<p>Many other keywords such
as <em>"Morning"</em>, <em>"Workout"</em>, <em>"Commute"</em> etc have
fallen by the wayside over time in favor of range controls and more
generally useful keys.  Highly specific genre categories usually got
tedious to maintain but may be useful for specific collections. </p>

  </div>
</div> <!-- epandiv -->

<p><img class="manmdimg" src="../docs/illuStarFilter.png"/> Star values are
filtered using a 5-way toggle button.  <em>"Standard"</em> means 2.5 stars
or higher, so it includes all songs that have not had their rating value
adjusted from the default initial value.  If you want to play just your
favorite hits, or delve into the depths, click to adjust accordingly.
Digger prefers songs you've least recently listened to, so you'll get
fullest possible coverage of your collection at whatever rating level you
select.</p>

<p><img class="manmdimg" src="../docs/illuTagFilter.png"/> The normal
setting for keyword tag access is <em>"Allow Untagged"</em> which means
keyword tag filtering works as you would probably expect.  If you only want
to play songs that have no associated keywords at all, you can change this
to
<em>"Untagged Only"</em>.  The opposite of that is <em>"Tagged Only"</em>.
Unless you are currently obsessed with tagging all songs in your
collection, <em>"Allow Untagged"</em> is probably what you want. </p>

<p><img class="manmdimg" src="../docs/illuFq.png"/> The frequency filtering
button is normally on, meaning that Digger will not suggest a song if it was
played in the past 24hrs, or longer if it was marked as tired.  If you've
run out of songs on deck due to frequency filtering, this toggle lets you
see which songs would otherwise have been eligible to play. </p>

  </div>
</div>


<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>Viewing and tuning songs on deck</h2>
  <div>

<p>The info (<img class="manimg" src="../img/info.png"/>) button gives a
short summary of how many songs in your collection passed each of the
filters.  The history (<img class="manimg" src="../img/history.png"/>)
button shows songs you've played before.  Clicking any deck song overlays an
action bar where you can </p>

<table class="manicotable">
  <tr><td><img class="manimginv" src="../img/play.png"/></td>
    <td>Play this song right now.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img class="manimginv" src="../img/bumpup.png"/></td>
    <td>Play this song next, or after the last song previously bumped to
    play next. </td></tr>
  <tr><td><img class="manimginv" src="../img/skipw.png"/></td>
    <td>Skip playing this song.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img class="manimginv" src="../img/snooze.png"/></td>
    <td>Verify marked as tired and skip.</td></tr>

<div class="topicdiv">
  <h2>DiggerHub</h2>
  <div>

<p>Click <em>Digger</em> in the upper left of the app to sign in for backup,
sync, and optional structured collaboration. </p>

<p>Digger saves song annotations and playback times to the hub as you
listen.  If you ever need to install Digger from scratch, just sign in to
pull down all your previously synchronized annotation and playback data.  If
you have a lot of song ratings, you might see the "hub" indicator light
staying lit for a little while.  Click it to view progress details.  A full
restore can take a minute or more, but after initial sync, incremental sync
operations typically take under a second. </p>

<p>If you like, you can try structured interactions with fellow music fans
to find music you have in common, get recommendations for songs you don't
have, or fill default info for songs you haven't annotated yet. </p>

<p>Visit DiggerHub for more info. </p>
