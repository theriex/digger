<h1>Music Friends</h1>

<p>A music friend is a friend whose musical listening interests and
reactions you respect and enjoy.  You might not agree on everything, but you
definitely agree on some things, and music is something you talk about. </p>

<p>Back in the day, when you went over to a friend's house, you would check
out their album collection, see how much you recognize, check out what you
don't recognize, and maybe talk about what you've been listening to
recently.  Your friend might play something they think you should hear, or
let you choose something to put on.  Radio and mixtapes were also key, but
those adapted to the digital age while friend music interactions had a
harder time.</p>

<p>Browsing music collections doesn't work anymore because they exist on
screen, not as part of the room.  Without the constraints of physical space,
libraries can get very large.  If you have a collection that has grown big,
you'll notice it takes more and more effort to find what you want to play.
How we access our collections needs help to make it easier to enjoy our
music and bring back interactions with friends. </p>

<p>What are some of the types of friend interactions?</p>


<h2>Have you heard...</h2>

<p>Some of the most treasured music in my collection came from friends that
pointed out gems I hadn't discovered yet.  If they hadn't clued me in, I
might have missed out on music I've listened to for years since.</p>

<p>Digger supports suggestions of new music from friends.  If a music
source supports it, friend-suggested songs matching your current retrieval
parameters are included on deck.  When you play a recommended song, it is
added to your collection with the ratings you set.  You can activate up to 4
friends at once all providing suggestions of music to play. </p>


<h2>This song is amazing!</h2>

<p>Sometimes when you listen to a song or album, the experience is so
exceptional it must immediately be shared with friends who might also
appreciate it.  To help with the typing, Digger fills out text about the
song that is playing, and some of what's on deck, to provide context. </p>


<h2>Notable artistic aspects</h2>

<p>When you are listening, you might be struck by aspects of the
composition, performance, production, or other magic that is worth noting
for your future self and any friend you might be providing suggestions to.
Put these notes in the song comment field to capture them. </p>


<h2>Context</h2>

<p>Songs are recorded in a studio or at a live performance, but sometimes
there is more to it.  Friends in the know often share amusing or
illuminating anecdotes about the song background, contractual obligations,
recording situations or other info.  These anecdotes can also be put in the
comment field, but there is an opportunity here to do more.  Context might be
more stories than facts, but it's always fun to hear from friends. </p>


<h2>Relationships</h2>

<p>Great music is made by great musicians, and it can be rewarding to see
what else they have done who else they have worked with.  Some relationships
are surprising and lead to things you might not have explored otherwise.
Looking forward to developing this further. </p>


<h2>Personal connections</h2>

<p>Nothing beats directly supporting artists you like.  "I saw them live"
expresses both appreciation and commitment.  Any connection to the creative
process is great and worth sharing, including music purchases and other
items that directly benefit artists.  Most musicians don't get enough
support from streaming.  You should be able to see more of how your friends
are connecting to the music. </p>


<h2>Happenings</h2>

<p>New releases, upcoming concerts, and other happenings are important to
know about.  It's a drag missing something you would have wanted to go see.
Friends are good source, but looking forward to connecting with services to
get the scoop on what's going on. </p>


<h2>Help with setup</h2>

<p>Friends also help you get set up.  When you add a music friend, Digger
checks their library for songs you haven't rated yet and copies their rating
info to jump start your tuned listening experience.  When you rate your own
music you help friends discover music they want to hear.  All while you get
back into enjoying music in your library. </p>

<!--

DiggerHub collaboration walks through your active music friends in order,
checking each friend to see if they can contribute default ratings for songs
you haven't rated yet.  Up to 200 rated songs are returned per call.  The
checksince attribute for each music friend is updated with either the
creation time of the last song rating contributed, or the current time if
the friend has no more song ratings left to contribute.  After
collaborations are updated, friend ratings are checked at most once a day.

If you adjust the ratings while a song is playing, that song is now yours
and those are no longer your friend's default ratings.  If you deactivate a
friend, ratings they have contributed stick around.  If you remove a friend,
then their default ratings are also removed.

When you update your active music friends, or click the info button next to
an active music friend.  Digger calls /api/mfcontrib on the hub.  If you are
running music locally, any songs not on the hub yet are first uploaded so
theyare available for collaboration.  If this is your first time
collaborating, and you have a lot of local music, the initial upload might
take a few minutes.  After that, only newly added songs need to be uploaded.
Uploading new music resets the checksince time for all of your music friends
and restarts the collaboration process.
